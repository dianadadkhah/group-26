## Project Summary (10,000-foot Overview)

This project investigates whether a machine learning model can accurately predict if an apartment in the U.S. is high-priced relative to the median rent within its state. The model leverages features such as location, size, and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms to make these predictions. With rental affordability becoming an increasingly important issue in America, we were interested in understanding how rental prices vary across states and how this variation affects the ability of renters, landlords, and policymakers to identify what determines a “high-priced” apartment in a given area.
