Project Summary (10,000-foot Overview)
This project investigates whether machine learning models can accurately predict the rental price of an apartment using its characteristics — such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and image-derived features. By training multiple predictive models on a large “Apartment for Rent” classified dataset, our goal is to identify the most accurate and reliable model for rental price estimation. This work can help renters, landlords, and property platforms make more data-driven decisions.
